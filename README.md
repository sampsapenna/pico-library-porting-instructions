# Library porting instructions for Pico SDK
As of now (2023) Pico SDK doesn't have as wide of a library support as Arduino IDE does.
This repository aims to document common differences between the two environments, in
order to simplify the process of porting between the two enfironments.

The repository contains both common instructions for porting a C++ library using
Arduino IDE builtins to use Pico SDK, and other miscallaneous things.

Consider it something of a notebook of mine. In case you think something is worth adding
here, create an issue. If there's a wiki somewhere where this would be a better fit,
feel free to copy the contents over.
